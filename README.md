# Whitehall App

"Whitehall" is the code name for the
[Inside Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/) project, which
aims to bring Government departments online in a consistent and
user-friendly manner. Documentation can be found on [rdoc](http://rdoc.info/github/alphagov/whitehall/frames).

## Nomenclature

* *Govspeak* A variation of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) 
used throughout 'Whitehall' as the general publishing format

## Quickstart

    docker-compose -f build/docker-compose.yml build
    docker-compose -f build/docker-compose.yml up

## Technical Documentation

Whitehall is a Rails 4 app built on a MySQL database. It is deployed
in two modes, 'admin' for publishers to create and manage content and
'frontend' for rendering content under https://www.gov.uk/government. In addition to
storing and managing its own content database Whitehall also updates
various other APIs including search and is currently being migrated
towards a new publishing model utilising [Publishing
API](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api) and 
[Content Store](https://github.com/alphagov/content-store).

## Dependencies

* Xcode (for the Command Line Tools `xcode-select --install`)
* Ruby 2.2.3
* Rubygems and Bundler
* Mysql
* Imagemagick and Ghostscript (for generating thumbnails of uploaded
  PDFs)
* xpdf (first download [XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org/))
* PhantomJS (for running the Javascript tests)

## Running the application

The application can be started with

```
bundle exec rails s
```

Note that the application itself will respond to requests on the root URL `/` with a
routing error. To check that it works, try visiting `/government/admin` and `/government/organisations`.

Further setup instructions are available in the [detailed setup guide](docs/detailed_setup_guide.md)

## Running the test suite

See the [testing guide](docs/testing_guide.md)

## Assets

GOV.UK shares assets (eg stylesheets and JavaScript) across apps using the
[`slimmer` gem](https://github.com/alphagov/slimmer) and the [`static`
app](https://github.com/alphagov/static). 

See the [local asset setup guide](docs/local_asset_setup_guide.md) 

## Search

The Whitehall app relies on
[Rummager](https://github.com/alphagov/rummager) for document
indexing, and the
[GOV.UK frontend application](https://github.com/alphagov/frontend) to
serve results.

See the [search setup guide](docs/search_setup_guide.md)
